Place all folders inside your PWGL-User directory (overwriting older ones if neccessary).
in OSX it is in ~/PWGL-User/User-Library (i.e.: /Users/<your username>/PWGL-User)

Open PWGL, load the zosc library (File/Load Library) and then go to Help/Pwgl Help. 
In the pane Library Tutorials you will find some examples.
(Pd-extended, Max/MSP, SuperCollider and Processing simple examples are included to test the library).

Thanks to Mika Kuuskankare for the suggestions/corrections.
